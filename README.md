# Fluent Spring JDBCTemplate
Introducing "fluent" style of coding into Spring JDBCTemplate

This small library provides a facade to the commonly used NamedParameterJdbcTemplate from spring-jdbc module, offering fluent "Java8 like" style of writing SQL statements and commands. We do not aim to replace the NamedParameterJdbcTemplate, we just want to extend its functionality and try to offer a simpler way how to use it.
